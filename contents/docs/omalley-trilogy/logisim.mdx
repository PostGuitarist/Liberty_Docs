## MacOS .app
Typically, you would run Logisim by running the `.jar` file. However, the `.jar` file will not show up on the MacOS launchpad. To make it easier to run Logisim, you can download the `.app` file below.

Download the Logisim-2.7.1.app from [here](https://github.com/PostGuitarist/JARtoApp/releases)

**Note: This is just a repackaged .jar served as a .app created by Zaden Connell.**

## Running the .jar file

If you prefer the standard way, Logisim is available as a `.jar` file. You can download the `.jar` file from the [Sourceforge website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/files/2.7.x/2.7.1/).
