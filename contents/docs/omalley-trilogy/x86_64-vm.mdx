You must create an x86_64 VM that will be used in all of the O'Malley classes. This is a one-time setup that will be used throughout the trilogy.

<br />

<Note title="Important" type="warning">
    x86-64 VMs with a GUI are required. UTM/QEMU emulation is slow, and you may experience crashes with hevay resources like VSCode.
</Note>

## Pre-requisites

- [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)

## x86_64 Setup

1. Open UTM and click the `+` button to create a new VM
2. Select `Emulate` and then `Linux`
3. Select the x86_64 Ubuntu ISO. You must use the version O'Malley has given you
3. Set the `RAM` to **AT LOT** of your total RAM. We recommend at least `8GB` if you have 32GB
4. Set the `CPU Cores` to **AT LOT** of your total cores. We recommend at least `4` if you have an 8-core CPU
5. Set the `Storage`. We recommend at least `32GB`
6. Set a `Shared Directory Path`. We recommend just using your `Downloads` folder

## Post-Setup

Now, there are some other settings you must change to get the best performance.

1. Click on the `Settings` button for the VM
2. Click on `System` and enable `Force Multicore`
3. Click `Save`

## Post-Ubuntu Install

Finally, there are some drivers and other utilities you must install.

1. Open the terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install nasm
sudo apt install qemu-system-i386
```
