    Nothing in this folder is guaranteed to work. We are up to some hackery and fun, so check back later for more information.

This documentation will cover how to get by in most of the O'Malley Trilogy classes using a M1(+) MacOS device.

This documentation is **NOT** guaranteed to work for Dr. O'Malley's classes. He has not tested this documentation and has not approved it. This is a community-driven project and is not officially supported by Dr. O'Malley.
