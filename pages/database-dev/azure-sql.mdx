# Azure SQL Database

We will create an Azure SQL Database. This will be the most commonly used database in CSCN-326.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Make sure to look at the <a href="/docs/azure/azure-sql#billing-issues">Billing Issues</a> section to prevent billing issues. This is a **major** problem!!!
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  We do not recommend making multiple databases on the same server. This will cause billing issues. If you need multiple databases, create a new server for each database.
</Callout>

## Create a new Azure SQL Database

Select `Free services`

Scroll down and click `Create` on `Azure SQL Database`

1. Change the Subscription to `Azure for Students`
2. Create or select a Resource Group
3. Enter a database name
4. Next to Server, click `Create new`
- Enter a server name
- Set the server location to `East US` (Use East US 2 if East US is not working)
- Change `Authentication method` to `Use SQL authentication`
- Enter a username and password you will remember
5. Go through the rest of the options to ensure features that cost money are disabled (Security, etc.)
6. Go to `Review + create` and then click `Create`

## Networking the Azure SQL Database

1. Go to the Azure portal and click on your database server under Resources
2. In the Overview tab, click `Show networking settings`
3. Set `Public access` to `Selected networks`
4. Under the Firewall rules, click `Add a firewall rule`
- Enter a **Start IP** of `0.0.0.0` and an **End IP** of `255.255.255.255`
5. Click `Allow Azure services and resources to access this server`
6. Click **Save**

## Billing Issues

Sometimes SQL Databases will overwork and cause billing issues. To prevent this, we will set a limit on the database.

1. Go to the Azure portal and click on your SQL Database under Resources. ***NOT*** the server.
2. Change tabs to `Compute + storage`
3. Ensure `Free database offer (Preview)` is selected
4. Set `Behavior when free offer limit reached` to `Auto-pause the database until next month`
5. Change `Max vCores` to `1`
6. Ensure `Auto-pause delay` is enabled
7. Click `Apply`

If you create a new database on the server, you need to follow these other steps to ensure it is free.

1. Go to the Azure portal and click on your SQL Database Server under Resources. ***NOT*** the database.
2. In the `Overview` tab, scroll down and click the database.
3. Change tabs to `Compute + storage`
4. Change `Service tier` to `General Purpose`
5. Change `Compute tier` to `Serverless`
6. Ensure the `Computer Hardware` is `Standard-series (Gen5)`
7. Ensure `Max vCores` is `1`
8. Ensure `Auto-pause delay` is enabled
9. Click `Apply`

## Connecting to the Azure SQL Database

Go to the resource **Overview** tab and copy the `Server name`. This is the server name you will use to connect to the database.

1. Open Azure Data Studio and click `New Connection`
2. Enter the `Server name` you copied earlier into `Server`
3. Enter the **Username** and **Password** you created earlier, and click `Save Password`
4. Click `Connect`

You should now be connected to your Azure SQL Database.

From here, you can create a new database, create tables, and run queries. We recommend looking at the [Azure Data Studio Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15) to learn more about Azure Data Studio.
