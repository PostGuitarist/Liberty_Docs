# Azure SQL Database

We will create an Azure SQL Database. This will be the most commonly used database in CSCN-326.

## Create a new Azure SQL Database

Select **Free services**

Scroll down and click **Create** on **Azure SQL Database**

1. Change the Subscription to **Azure for Students**
2. Create or select a Resource Group
3. Enter a database name
4. Next to Server, click **Create new**
- Enter a server name
- Set the server location to **East US** (Use East US 2 if East US is not working)
- Change **Authentication method** to **Use SQL authentication**
- Enter a username and password you will remember
5. Go through the rest of the options to ensure features that cost money are disabled (Security, etc.)
6. Go to **Review + create** and then click **Create**

## Networking the Azure SQL Database

1. Go to the Azure portal and click on your database **server** under **Resources**
2. In the Overview tab, click **Show networking settings**
3. Set **Public access** to **Selected networks**
4. Under the Firewall rules, click **Add a firewall rule**
- Enter a **Start IP** of **0.0.0.0** and an **End IP** of **255.255.255.255**
5. Click **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server**
6. Click **Save**

## Connecting to the Azure SQL Database

Go to the resource **Overview** tab and copy the **Server name**. This is the server name you will use to connect to the database.

1. Open Azure Data Studio and click **New Connection**
2. Enter the **Server name** you copied earlier into **Server**
3. Enter the **Username** and **Password** you created earlier, and click **Save Password**
4. Click **Connect**

You should now be connected to your Azure SQL Database.

From here, you can create a new database, create tables, and run queries. We recommend looking at the [Azure Data Studio Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15) to learn more about Azure Data Studio.
