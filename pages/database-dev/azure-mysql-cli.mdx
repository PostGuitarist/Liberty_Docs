# MySQL CLI Development

If you are developing MySQL scripts locally and want to deploy them to Azure, you can use [Azure Data Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?tabs=win-install%2Cwin-user-install%2Credhat-install%2Cwindows-uninstall%2Credhat-uninstall#download-azure-data-studio) to connect to your Azure Database for MySQL server and run your scripts.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure Data Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?tabs=win-install%2Cwin-user-install%2Credhat-install%2Cwindows-uninstall%2Credhat-uninstall#download-azure-data-studio) installed on your local machine.

- [MySQL for MacOS](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) installed on your local machine.

## Connect to Azure Database for MySQL by CLI

1. Open a terminal window and connect to your Azure Database for MySQL server using the following command:

    ```bash
    mysql -h [SERVER_NAME].mysql.database.azure.com -u [YOUR_USERNAME] -p
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter your password.

    ```
    Enter password:
    ```

    Enter the password you used when you created the server.

    Now, you are connected to your Azure Database for MySQL server.

### Run MySQL scripts

To run MySQL scripts by CLI, you can use the following command:

```bash
mysql -h [SERVER_NAME].mysql.database.azure.com -u <YOUR_USERNAME>@[SERVER_NAME] -p [DATABASE_NAME] < [SCRIPT_NAME].sql
```

You will be prompted to enter your password.

```
Enter password:
```

Enter the password you used when you created the server.

Now, your script will be executed, and you will see the results in the terminal window.
