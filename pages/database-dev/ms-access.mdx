# Microsoft Access Usage
For some of the labs and assignments, you will need to use Microsoft Access. This page will guide you through the process of installing and using Microsoft Access.

### Pre-requisites
- UTM with Windows 11

### Installation
1. Inside the UTM machine, open the browser
2. Go to [Liberty's MS-365 Center](https://www.liberty.edu/information-services/products/microsoft-365/)
3. Click on the `Desktop` button under **Download Microsoft 365**
4. Now in the portal, click on `Install Office`
5. Install the Office suite by following the on-screen instructions

### Usage
1. Open the `Start` menu and search for `Access`
2. Click on the `Access` app to open it
3. You can now create a new database or open an existing one

## Sharing the Database files with MacOS
Using UTM, you can set a shared folder between Windows and MacOS. This will allow you to easily transfer files between the two operating systems.

1. Open UTM, select the Windows 11 virtual machine and click on `Settings`
2. Click on `Sharing`
3. Click on `Browse` next to the `Path` field
4. Select the folder you want to share and click on `Open`

We recommend just using the `Downloads` folder for simplicity.
