# Microsoft Access Usage
For some of the labs and assignments, you will need to use Microsoft Access. This page will guide you through the process of installing and using Microsoft Access.

### Pre-requisites
- UTM with Windows 11

### Installation
1. Inside the UTM machine, open the browser
2. Go to [Liberty's MS-365 Center](https://www.liberty.edu/information-services/products/microsoft-365/)
3. Click on the `Desktop` button under **Download Microsoft 365**
4. Now in the portal, click on `Install Office`
5. Install the Office suite by following the on-screen instructions

### Usage
1. Open the `Start` menu and search for `Access`
2. Click on the `Access` app to open it
3. You can now create a new database or open an existing one

### Exporting via ODBC
You will need to export the databases created in Microsoft Access to your SQL Server.

First, ensure in the UTM machine settings under `Network` that the `Network Mode` is set to `Shared Network`.

1. Open MS Access and open the database you want to export
2. Click on `External Data` in the top menu
3. Click on `More` and then `ODBC Database`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to export the database to your SQL Server, but select `Machine Data Source` instead of `File Data Source`
5. Select `New` and then `User Data Source`
6. Select `SQL Server` and click `Next`
7. For the `Server` field, you must use the `Default Gateway` IP address the UTM machine is using. You can find this by running `ipconfig` in the command prompt in the UTM machine
8. Enter your SQL Server credentials and click `Next`. This should be the same credentials you use to login to the SQL Server
9. Continue through the steps, and ensure to click `Test Connection` to ensure the connection is working


## Sharing the Database files with MacOS
Using UTM, you can set a shared folder between Windows and MacOS. This will allow you to easily transfer files between the two operating systems.

1. Open UTM, select the Windows 11 virtual machine and click on `Settings`
2. Click on `Sharing`
3. Click on `Browse` next to the `Path` field
4. Select the folder you want to share and click on `Open`

We recommend just using the `Downloads` folder for simplicity.
