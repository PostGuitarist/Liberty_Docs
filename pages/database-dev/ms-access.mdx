# Microsoft Access Usage
For some of the labs and assignments, you will need to use Microsoft Access. This page will guide you through the process of installing and using Microsoft Access.

### Pre-requisites
- [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)
    - Windows 11 ARM Installed

### Installation
1. Inside the UTM machine, open the browser
2. Go to [Liberty's MS-365 Center](https://www.liberty.edu/information-services/products/microsoft-365/)
3. Click on the `Desktop` button under **Download Microsoft 365**
4. Now in the portal, click on `Install Office`
5. Install the Office suite by following the on-screen instructions

### Usage
1. Open the `Start` menu and search for `Access`
2. Click on the `Access` app to open it
3. You can now create a new database or open an existing one

### Exporting via CSV Hint
You can also export via CSV, and we have a small hint to help with that. The formula below will help you export a table to a CSV file. You can then import the CSV file into your SQL Server.

```txt
="INSERT INTO Regions VALUES("&A2&",'"&B2&"')"
```

Take this as you will...

### Exporting via ODBC
You will need to export the databases created in Microsoft Access to your SQL Server.

First, ensure in the UTM machine settings under `Network` that the `Network Mode` is set to `Shared Network`.

1. Open MS Access and open the database you want to export
2. Click on `External Data` in the top menu
3. Click on `More` and then `ODBC Database`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to export the database to your SQL Server, but select `Machine Data Source` instead of `File Data Source`
5. Select `New` and then `User Data Source`
6. Select `SQL Server` and click `Next`
7. For the `Server` field, you must use the `Default Gateway` IP address the UTM machine is using. You can find this by running `ipconfig` in the command prompt in the UTM machine
8. Enter your SQL Server credentials and click `Next`. This should be the same credentials you use to login to the SQL Server
9. Continue through the steps, and ensure to click `Test Connection` to ensure the connection is working


## Sharing the Database files with MacOS
Using UTM, you can set a shared folder between Windows and MacOS. This will allow you to easily transfer files between the two operating systems.

1. Open UTM, select the Windows 11 virtual machine and click the disk icon in the top right
2. Select `Install Windows Guest Tools`
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the tools

Now, the process gets to be a bit tricky. You will need to share a folder between Windows and MacOS. This will allow you to easily transfer files between the two operating systems. However, we are going to map it as a network drive in Windows.

1. Open your MacOS settings and go to `Sharing`
2. Turn on `File Sharing` and click on the `i` icon next to it
3. Click the `+` button on the ***Shared Folders*** section and select the folder you want to share. We recommend just using the `Downloads` folder for simplicity
4. Click the fodler in the list and ensure your account has `Read & Write` permissions, and ***Everyone*** has `No Access`
5. Click the `Options...` button and ensure `Share files and folders using SMB` is checked

Now, you will need to map the shared folder as a network drive in Windows. Open up the Windows UTM machine and follow these steps:

1. Open the command prompt and run `ipconfig` to find the `Default Gateway` IP address. Save this for later
2. Open `File Explorer` and right-click on `This PC` and select `Map network drive`
3. Enter the following in the `Folder` field: 
```txt 
\\<Default Gateway IP Address>\Downloads
``` 
(or the folder you shared)

4. Ensure `Reconnect at sign-in` is checked and click `Finish`
5. Click `Finish` and enter your MacOS credentials when prompted. This is the same credentials you use to login to MacOS, so it should be your MacOS username and password
6. Ensure your select `Remember my credentials` at the `Enter network credentials` prompt
7. You should now see the shared folder as a network drive in Windows
