# Azure Setup

Azure provides a robust and scalable platform for database development, offering services like Azure SQL Database and Azure Database for MySQL. These services support a wide range of database operations, making Azure a versatile choice for us to use in CSCN-326.

Use an application like [Azure Data Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=win-install%2Cwin-user-install%2Credhat-install%2Cwindows-uninstall%2Credhat-uninstall#download-azure-data-studio) to connect to the databases.

Click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students) and sign up for an Azure account using your Liberty email address.

After signing up, you will be taken to the Azure portal. Click on the title **Microsoft Azure** at the top to ensure you are on the correct dashboard, and then hit **More services** under Azure services.
