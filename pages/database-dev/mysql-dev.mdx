# Local MySQL Database

We will create a Local MySQL Database. This will be used in CSCN-326.

## Create a new Local MySQL Database

### Pre-requisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Azure Data Studio MySQL Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/extensions/mysql-extension#install-the-mysql-extension)

### Steps

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to pull the latest SQL Server image from Docker Hub
    ```bash
    docker run --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=VeryStr0ngP@ssw0rd -d mysql:latest
    ```

2. Check Docker to make sure the container is running

## Connecting to the Local MySQL Database

1. Open Azure Data Studio and click `New Connection`
2. Change `Connection Type` to `MySQL`
2. Enter `localhost` into `Server`
3. Enter `VeryStr0ngP@ssw0rd` into `Password`
4. Click `Remember Password`
5. Click `Advanced`
6. Enter `3306` into `Port`
7. Click `Connect`

```bash
    Password: VeryStr0ngP@ssw0rd
```

You should now be connected to your Local MySQL Database.

From here, you can create a new database, create tables, and run queries. We recommend looking at the [Azure Data Studio Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15) to learn more about Azure Data Studio.

# MySQL CLI Development

## Install MySQL CLI

If you are using a Mac, you can install MySQL CLI by using the following command:

```bash
brew install mysql
```

## Connect to Local MySQL Database by CLI

Open a terminal window and connect to your Local MySQL Database server using the following command:

```bash
mysql -h localhost -u root -p [DATABASE_NAME]
```

You will be prompted to enter your password.

```
Enter password:
```

Enter the password you used when you created the server.

Now, you are connected to your Local MySQL Database.

## Run MySQL Scripts by CLI

To run MySQL scripts by CLI, you can use the following command:

```bash
mysql -h localhost -u root -p [DATABASE_NAME] < [SCRIPT_NAME].sql
```

You will be prompted to enter your password.

```
Enter password:
```

Enter the password you used when you created the server.

Now, your script will be executed, and you will see the results in the terminal window.
