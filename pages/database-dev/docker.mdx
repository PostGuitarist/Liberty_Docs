# Docker

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, run, and share applications with containers. The use of containers to deploy applications is called containerization. Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

## Installation

1. Go to [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download the installer
2. Run the installer
3. Follow the instructions on the installer, using the recommended settings
4. Click `Close` when the installation is complete

## Using Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is where the containers are managed. You can see the status of the containers, start and stop them, and create new containers.

To start a container, click `Start` next to the container you want to start. 
To stop a container, click `Stop` next to the container you want to stop.

**DO NOT DELETE CONTAINERS**. The containers are configured to run with the correct settings for the class. Deleting a container will delete all of the data in the container. If you accidentally delete a container, you will need to create a new container with the correct settings.

## Saving Battery Life

Docker Desktop can be a battery hog. To save battery life, you can stop Docker Desktop from running in the background when you are not using it.

1. Inside docker, click the Settings icon in the top right corner
2. Ensure `Start Docker Desktop when you sign in to your computer` is unchecked
3. In `Resources > Advanced`, set `CPU limit` to 4, and `Memory limit` to `8.0 GB`
4. Scroll down while still in `Resources > Advanced` and check `Enable Resource Saver`. Then set it to `30 sec`.

Docker will also run in the background when you close the app. You can tell by looking at the icon in the upper right corner of your screen. To fully close Docker Desktop, click the icon and click `Quit Docker Desktop`.
