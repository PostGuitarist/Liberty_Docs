# Azure Database for MySQL

We will create an Azure Database for MySQL. This will be used in CSCN-326.

## Create a new Azure Database for MySQL

Select **Free services**

Scroll down and click **Create** on **Azure Database for MySQL**

Click **Create** on the **Flexible Server** option

1. Change the Subscription to **Azure for Students**
2. Create or select a Resource Group
3. Enter a server name
- Set the server location to **East US** (Use East US 2 if East US is causing deployment issues)
- Change **Authentication method** to **MySQL authentication only**
- Enter a username and password you will remember
4. Go through the rest of the options to ensure features that cost money are disabled (Security, etc.)
5. Go to **Review + create** and then click **Create**

## Networking the Azure Database for MySQL

1. Go to the Azure portal and click on your database **server** under **Resources**
2. In the Overview tab, scroll down and click **Configure Networking**
3. Select **Allow public access to this resource through the internet using a public IP address**
4. Under the Firewall rules, click **Allow public access from any Azure service within Azure to this server**
5. Click **+ Add 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255**
6. Click **Save**

## Connecting to the Azure Database for MySQL

Go to the resource **Overview** tab and copy the **Server name**. This is the server name you will use to connect to the database.

If you are using Azure Data Studio, download the MySQL extension. To do this, click on the **Extensions** tab on the left side of Azure Data Studio. You can just search for **MySQL** and install the extension.

1. Open Azure Data Studio and click **New Connection**
2. Change the **Connection type** to **MySQL**
3. Enter the **Server name** you copied earlier into **Server name**
3. Enter the **Username** and **Password** you created earlier, and click **Save Password**
4. Click **Connect**

You should now be connected to your Azure SQL Database.

From here, you can create a new database, create tables, and run queries. We recommend looking at the [Azure Data Studio Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15) to learn more about Azure Data Studio.
