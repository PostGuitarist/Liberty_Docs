# VSCode to Visual Studio Extension

This extension was created with the same idea as Cameron Kauffman's command line program to convert C++ projects into Visual Studio projects. 

I (Zaden Connell) wanted to create a Visual Studio extension that would allow you to convert a VSCode workspace into a Visual Studio solution. This extension is the result of that.

## Installation

You can install this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](#). (Coming soon)

You can also install this extension from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/PostGuitarist/vscode-to-vs-extension/releases).

To install from the .vsix file, open Visual Studio and go to `Extensions > Views and More Actions > Install from VSIX` and select the .vsix file.

You can also install by downloading the .vsix file and running 
```bash
code --install-extension vscode-to-vs-extension-1.0.0.vsix
```

## Usage

To use this extension, open a VSCode workspace where your `.cpp` and `.h`, etc. files are located. Then, open the command palette run `Generate C++ Solution Files`. This will create a Visual Studio solution file in the root of the workspace.
