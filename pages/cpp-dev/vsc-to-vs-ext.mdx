# VSCode to Visual Studio Extension

This extension was created with the same idea as Cameron Kauffman's command line program to convert C++ projects into Visual Studio projects. 

I (Zaden Connell) wanted to create a Visual Studio extension that allows you to convert a VSCode workspace into a Visual Studio solution. This extension is the result of that.

## Installation

Install this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PostGuitarist.vscode-to-vs).

You can also install this extension from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/PostGuitarist/vscode-to-vs-extension/releases).

## Usage

To use this extension, open a VSCode workspace where your `.cpp` and `.h`, etc. files are located. Then, open the command palette and run `Generate C++ Solution Files`. This will create a Visual Studio solution file in the workspace's root.
