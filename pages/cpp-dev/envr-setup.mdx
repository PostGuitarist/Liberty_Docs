# Setting Up The Environment

Setting up MacOS for C++ development is much easier than others would like you to believe.

## Install Visual Studio Code

If you head to the [download link](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) and click either the *Apple silicon* or *Intel chip* version (depending on how new your Mac is).

Once downloaded, open the `.zip` file and then drag the `Visual Studio Code.app` file into your `Applications` folder.

This is going to be your code editor, the difference between Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio is that Visual Studio Code is a code editor, whereas Visual Studio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

We are able to use Visual Studio Code along with the C++ compiler to do all of the things that we need to do.

## Install Brew

Brew is a package manager. Much like `apt` on Debian based Linux distributions, `brew` allows us to install packages from the command line.

If you haven't used Linux or done CSCN 345, don't worry, it's not that hard.

Open up a terminal window by pressing `cmd + space` and then typing `terminal` and pressing enter.

Then head to [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) and copy the command under the *Install Homebrew* heading.

Paste this into your terminal and press enter.

This will install homebrew, and you will be able to use it to install packages.
