# Create HTML files using TextEdit

To use TextEdit to edit HTML, you first need to create an HTML file, which you can do by opening TextEdit. Pressing `cmd + space` will pull up the spotlight menu, and type in "TextEdit".

Once TextEdit is open, go to the folder in which you want to make the file and click the **New Document** button. TextEdit will then open a blank file. 

You then want to press `cmd + s` to save the file. Type in the file name and change the format to **Web Page (.html)**.

# Use TextEdit to edit HTML

With TextEdit open and focused, you can head to the TextEdit settings by clicking the **TextEdit** button in the top left of your MacOS device. Then select **Settings** and the **Open and Save** tab and toggle the option "*Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text*".

If you close your file and open it back up with TextEdit, you should see the HTML code now.
