# Create HTML files using TextEdit

To use TextEdit to edit HTML you first need to create an HTML file, which you can do by opening TextEdit. Pressing `cmd + space` will pull up the spotlight menu and then type in "TextEdit".

Once TextEdit is open then go to the folder you want to make the file in and then click the **New Document** button. TextEdit will then open a blank file. 

You then want to press `cmd + s` to save the file. Type in the name of the file and then change the file format to **Web Page (.html)**.

# Use TextEdit to edit HTML

With TextEdit open and focused, you can head to the TextEdit settings by clicking the **TextEdit** button in the top left of your MacOS device. Then select **Settings** and the **Open and Save** tab and toggle the option that says "*Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text*".

If you close your file and open it back up with TextEdit, then you should now see the HTML code.
