# Virtual Machines

An important part of using a Mac in many soem of the classes is the ability to run Windows and Linux when needed. This will be helpful in classes like CSCN-345, CSCN-326, and others (to come later). This guide will walk you through the process of installing Windows and Linux on your Mac.

## UTM

UTM is a virtual machine manager for MacOS. It allows you to run virtual machines on your Mac. It is free and open source at [https://getutm.app/](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/). It is available on the Mac App Store, but the App Store version cost money. We recommend using the free version from the Github.

### Windows Installation

Windows is a little finicky to try and get. We recommend downloading the Windows 11 ARM version, as it works the fastest on MacOS. To do this, you will need to download [CrystalFetch](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This app will allow you to download the Windows 11 ARM ISO.

Once you have the ISO, you can start by:
- Open UTM and click the `+` button to open the VM creation wizard
- Select `Virtualize`
- Select `Windows`
- Ensure `Import VHDX Image` is ***unchecked*** and `Install Windows 10 or higher` is ***checked***.
- Ensure `Install drivers and SPICE tools` is ***checked***.
- Click `Browse` and select the Windows 11 ARM ISO you downloaded earlier.
- Select the amount of ***RAM*** and ***CPU cores*** you want to allocate to the VM. We recommend at least 6GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores.
- Select the amount of ***Storage*** you want to allocate to the VM. We recommend at least 32GB.
- Click `Next` until you get to the final screen, then click `Save`.
- Follow the instructions on the screen to install Windows.

### Linux Installation

Linux is a little easier to install. You can download the ISO from the Linux distribution's website. We recommend using Ubuntu, as it is the most beginner-friendly. You can download the ISO from [https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

We also recommend you get the ARM version of Ubuntu, as it will run the fastest on your Mac.

#### Ubuntu ARM
Once you have the ISO, you can start by:
- Open UTM and click the `+` button to open the VM creation wizard
- Select `Virtualize`
- Select `Linux`
- Click `Browse` and select the Ubuntu ARM ISO you downloaded earlier.
- Select the amount of ***RAM*** and ***CPU cores*** you want to allocate to the VM. We recommend at least 4GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores.
- Select the amount of ***Storage*** you want to allocate to the VM.
- Click `Next` until you get to the final screen, then click `Save`.
- Follow the instructions on the screen to install Ubuntu.

### Emulating a x86/x64 CPU
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Emulating an x86/x64 CPU is ***NOT*** recommended. It is very slow and can have issues.
</Callout>

UTM allows you to emulate an x86/x64 CPU on your Mac. This will allow you to run Windows and Linux distributions that are not ARM-compatible. This is a little more complicated, but we will walk you through it.

#### Windows x86/x64

To emulate an x86/x64 CPU, you will need to download the Windows 11 Disk Image image from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11). Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click `Select download`. Select `Windows 11 (multi-edition ISO for x64 devices)` and click `Download Now`.

Once you have the ISO, you can start by:
- Open UTM and click the `+` button to open the VM creation wizard
- Select `Emulate`
- Select `Windows`
- Click `Browse` and select the Windows 11 x64 ISO you downloaded earlier.
- Select the amount of ***RAM*** and ***CPU cores*** you want to allocate to the VM. We recommend at least 8GB of RAM and 6 CPU cores.
- Select the amount of ***Storage*** you want to allocate to the VM. We recommend at least 32GB.
- Click `Next` until you get to the final screen, then click `Save`.
