# Welcome to the LU CS Documentation

We will cover how to get by in most of the computer science classes using a M1(+) MacOS device.

The documentation ***should*** also work for Windows, Linux, and Intel MacOS devices, but it is not guaranteed. Any errors or issues related to usage on Windows or Linux will not be addressed. ***This is subject to change.***
