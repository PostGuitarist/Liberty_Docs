The O'Malley trilogy are soem of the hardest classes you will take at LU. They are also some of the most rewarding.  You will learn a lot, but you will also have to work hard. Here are some important things to know:

1. This section is a ***WIP***.  It will be updated as the semester progresses.  Please check back regularly.
2. Nothing in this folder is guaranteed to work. O'Malley has not guaranteed that any of this will work.  It is up to you to make sure that you are doing the right thing.
3. Should we find ways to ensure that you cn do his classes whiel still using a Mac, we will update this folder and it's contents.

We are up to some hackery and fun, so check back later for more information. We will be updating this folder as we go.
