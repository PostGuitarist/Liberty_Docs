# Download Logisim

Logisim is available as a `.jar` file, which means you can run it on any platform that has Java installed. You can download the `.jar` file from the [Sourceforge website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/files/2.7.x/2.7.1/).

## [Experimental] MacOS .app

Typically, you would run Logisim by running the `.jar` file. However, the `.jar` file will not show up on the MacOS launchpad. To make it easier to run Logisim, you can download the `.app` file below.

Download the Logisim.app runner from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D4OrkVm24Uz-FklG1poQqfY16Zd9wVj_/view?usp=sharing)

**Note: This is just a repackaged .jar served as a .app created by Zaden Connell. Source code is available if requested.**
